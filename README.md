# Love Art

Love Art is a place for artists to showcase their original artwork, and connect with art lovers.

Written in Ruby, it is a Sinatra application with a MVC skeleton and RESTful routes. It also includes some JavaScript (jQuery and AJAX). Object-Relational Mapping leverages ActiveRecord along with some single-table inheritance techniques.

This proof-of-concept was completed in four days as part of a personal side project, and is deployed [here](http://love-art.herokuapp.com) on Heroku.
